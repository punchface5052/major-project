# Reflection

## What Advice would I give myself?
 - It's really difficult to actually get into the coding within one hour, so be aware of the time constraints
 - FIX YOUR DARN AT HOME SYSTEM (I had some technical issues which made it so I couldn't work on this at home)
 - Don't underestimate the difficulty of simple tasks, while it may seem simple sometimes a single problem/bug can easily take multiple hours of coding
 - Don't be afraid to use external libraries

## Was my needs to have completed?
 - No, i still had some issues with phases and full level implementation 

## What was the hardest part of this project?
 - so much of the difficulty of timing and projectile implementation took much more work than expected and was most certainly the most difficult part

## Was there anything you couldn't implement
 - phases and timing, more cheese, special abilities
 - proper death - no time
 - sound effects
